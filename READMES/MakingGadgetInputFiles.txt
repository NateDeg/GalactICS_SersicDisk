Making a Gadget Initial Conditions File

After building a GalactICS model it is necessary to convert it to 
the correct format for your simulations.  The programs
GalCombine and ascii2gadget_gasIni are designed to prepare a Gadget 
Initial Conditions File.

—————
GalCombine

This program combines the various ascii outputs from GalactICS and 
produces an ascii file in the Gadget format.  The program requires 
that the various GalactICS output files (bulge, disk, halo, etc.) 
are located in the same folder and an input file (see the example
files located in GadgetConverters/InputFiles).

GalCombine is designed to combine the components for multiple 
galaxies (for merging experiments).  The input file allows 
the user to specify the number of galaxies, the number of components
per galaxy, and the initial position, velocity, and orientation 
of the galaxies.  Each galaxy component must be given a Gadget particle type.

GalCombine outputs ascii files for each galaxy, the Gadget ascii IC 
file, and a index file that lists the number of different components and 
particle ranges.  This Particle ID file has a format of:
galaxy		Component	Gadget Particle Type	First Particle ID	Last Particle ID

The command to run the program is:
./GalCombine InputFile

ascii2Gadget_gasIni

This program is a modified version of the ascii2Gadget program found 
in Gadget2.  It takes the output ascii from GalCombine and converts it
into a binary IC file that can be used in Gadget.
